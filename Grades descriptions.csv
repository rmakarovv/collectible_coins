More abrasions are acceptable, however, even in the prime focal areas. An MS 66 must still have strong eye appeal, but it can have negative issues, such as luster grazes or bag marks.
MS65;A combination of 3-5 noticeable scratches with a length of 4 mm, including 1-2 in the central areas. For gold coins weighing �1 ounce, traces of bag marks on 40-50% of the surface are acceptable.

MS64;Multiple rough marks, including scratches �5 mm long, crossing minor design elements.

This storage also resulted in more contact marks. The strike may or may not be weak. By this level, it is usually the luster, contact marks or lack of eye appeal that lower the grade.
